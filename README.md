# menu
This is a sample beginers menu for a small cafe built using HTML and CSS.
Menu is one page, uses rgb settings, and is addaptive to screen size.
Top Footer message is linked to my LinkedIn profile but can be changed.
Second footer message is written as if expecting an address and can be linked to a google maps location.
